# Portfolio 2

For my portfolio, I chose option 1.1.

For my second updated project (portfolio2_part2), I decided to update Lab 6. My three new components are called Counter, MultiplicationCalculator, and TodayDate.
Counter lets you click on two buttons. One will increase the displayed count by one, and the other will decrease the displayed count by one.Â 
MultiplicationCalculator will let you input two numbers. It will display the numbers you chose and what the numbers multiply to.
TodayDate asks the user what today's date is. It will display the user's input.
