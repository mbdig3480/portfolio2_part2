# Portfolio 2

For my portfolio, I chose option 1.1.

For my second updated project (portfolio2_part2), I decided to update week 6's exercise. My three new components are called AddShow, Poll, and UserExplanation. I also moved the existing Example and LikeButton files to their own folders in components to make the project more organized. AddShow lets you input your favorite show and favorite character. It will update the inputted text in real time. It displays your favorite show and favorite character in the line of text underneath the inputs. Poll lets you choose which post you liked the best in a dropdown menu. It will display your choice in text underneath the dropdown. UserExplanation lets you input what post you liked and why.
